									Services in Angular
									-------------------
									-------------------

	- Reusable code .
	- Use -:  when same code u share across the module to another module in Angular services is used .

	 Question : Defination of good Architectures ?
	 Answer : Changes at one place should not lead to change many place .

	- DI make Your architecture loosely coupled and their are two ways to create DI
	1] Centralize way -: centrally push object to the client .
	2] Conditional way -: The client decide which object he wants to inject .
	


	
	Steps to create Services
	------------------------

	step 1> create your service File .
		Example : student.service.ts
	
	step 2> import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'
		@Injectable()

		- Use Injectable decorator

	Questions : What is the purpose of injectable?
		Marking a class with @Injectable ensures that the compiler will generate the necessary metadata to create the class's dependencies when the class is injected.
		inside constructor. 

	step 3> Add export class to Your Service Component
		
		export class StudentService{

			// Add Logic here
		
		}
	
	step 4> Register Your Service Component in Two ways
		
		1] Global Level at NgModule-:

		   Example -:

 		   @NgModule({
			providers: [// Register Your Service here]
		   })

		2] Local Level at @Component -:
		   	
		Example -:
		
		@Component({
  			  selector:'ser-comp',
    			  templateUrl:'./service.component.html',
    			  providers:[StudentService]
		})


	step 5> Consume Your services by using Depedency Injection (DI)
		
		1] create instance of services inside component constructor

		Example :
		
		export class ServiceComponent{
			// create DI
			constructor(private stud:StudentService){}
		}
